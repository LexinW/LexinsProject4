User Story:: 
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

Acceptance Criteria:: 
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score


I didn't set my self up for success and wasn't able to start on the weekend. I started on the 9th, and because we learned about some third party APIs I tried incorporating some here, which kinda bit me in the ass.
I went step by step and got as far as I could. I started by adding some links for the google fonts and bootstrap (because I am awful at css and make it too confusing for myself). 

Starting with HTML, I created a header with the high score button and a timer on the left and right respectively. I gave the timer a class and the contents an id so I can use them in Javascript. 

Then I made the body in the HTML file for the main quiz and scorecard area. I added a little deescription of the quiz and a title. Also added a button to begin the challenge, which I use in javascript with
an Event listener for the click to start the function. 

I didn't do too much with Css, mainly copied from some previous work we've done in the class. 

Then the part I got overwhelmed. The javascript. At first it was simple, created a couple variables for the card and beingbtn variables. Created the array to store all our questions, answers, and options in. 
I created the begin challenge, set up the timer interval and linked it to the time-left class. Once I got to the display questions and display score card, I had to start googling so many different things, and trying to copy and paste from previous work. I ended up using different ways of doing the same thing that I started to get really confused. I tried getting as far as I can, but I didnt get to add a score card and make the high score button work. its almost the due date, so im just sibmitting what I have. 


I am going to start this weeks project during the weekend and if I need help again, ill be in office hours!! Thank you. - Lexin Wiesner
